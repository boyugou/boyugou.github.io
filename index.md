Hi, I'm Boyu, a Ph.D. student at The Ohio State University. I'm fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/) and [Prof. Huan Sun](https://u.osu.edu/ihudas/people/) at the [OSU NLP Group](https://twitter.com/osunlp).

My research interests lie in **[Language Agents](https://language-agent-tutorial.github.io/)**, with a specific focus on **[autonomous GUI agents](https://github.com/boyugou/GUI-Agents-Paper-List)** that can use computers or browse the web. 

We built the first multimodal web agent with all code open-sourced ([SeeAct](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/SeeAct/), [Multimodal-Mind2Web](https://huggingface.co/datasets/osunlp/Multimodal-Mind2Web)). After that, we proposed building purely vision-based GUI agents that can operate as humans do and demonstrated their power despite their minimal design ([UGround](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/UGround/)). We also built benchmarks to better assess cutting-edge web agents in short- to medium-horizon web agent tasks ([Online-Mind2Web](https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/Online-Mind2Web)) and long-horizon agentic web search tasks ([Mind2Web 2](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web-2/)), introducing novel LLM-as-a-Judge and rubric-based Agent-as-a-Judge methods.

*If you are interested in a research internship/collaboration, or just a short chat, feel free to email me or reach out on LinkedIn/Twitter to discuss ideas and potential collaborations.*

## News
- **[June 2025]** [Mind2Web 2](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web-2/) is released! A benchmark designed specifically for agentic search systems (e.g., web agents, Deep Research systems) on realistic, long-horizon, and time-varying tasks.
- **[Feb 2025]** [UGround](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/UGround/) is accepted to ICLR 2025 as an Oral!
- **[Aug 2024]** Released [UGround](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/UGround/), where we propose building entirely vision-only GUI agents under a generic framework SeeAct-V with a new SOTA GUI visual grounding model.
- **[Jan 2024]** Released [SeeAct](https://twitter.com/ysu_nlp/status/1742398541660639637), a generalist web agent powered by GPT-4V. (Accepted at ICML 2024)
- **[Aug 2023]** Joined OSU and am honored to work in the OSU NLP Group.
