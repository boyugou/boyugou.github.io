Hi, I'm Boyu, a Ph.D. student at The Ohio State University. I'm fortunately co-advised by [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/) and [Prof. Huan Sun](https://u.osu.edu/ihudas/people/) at [OSU NLP Group](https://twitter.com/osunlp).

My research interests lie in **[Language Agents](https://language-agent-tutorial.github.io/)**, with a specific focus on **[autonomous GUI agents](https://github.com/boyugou/GUI-Agents-Paper-List)** that can use computers or browse the web. 

We built the first multimodal web agent with all code opensourced ([SeeAct](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/SeeAct/), [Multimodal-Mind2Web]()). After that, we propose building purely vision-based GUI agents that can operate as humans do and demonstrate its power despite its minimal design ([UGround](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/UGround/)). We also built benchmarks to better assess cutting-edge web agents in short to medium horizon web navigation tasks ([Online-Mind2Web]()) and long-horizon agentic web search tasks ([Mind2Web 2]()) with novel LLM-as-a-Judge and rubric-based Agent-as-a-Judge method.

*If you interested in a research internship/collaboration or just a short chat, feel free to email me or reach out on LinkedIn/Twiter to discuss ideas and potential collaborations.*

## News
- **[June. 2025]** [Mind2Web 2](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web-2/) is released! A benchmark designed specifically for agentic search systems (e.g., web agents, Deep Research systems) on realistic, long-horizon and time-varying tasks.
- **[Feb. 2025]** [UGround](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/UGround/) is accepted to ICLR 2025 as an Oral!
- **[Oct. 2024]** Released [UGround](https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/UGround/), where we propose building entirely vision-only GUI agents under a generic framework SeeAct-V with a new SOTA GUI visual grounding model UGround.
- **[Jan. 2024]** Released [SeeAct](https://twitter.com/ysu_nlp/status/1742398541660639637), a generalist web agent powered by GPT-4V. (Accepted at ICML 2024)
- **[Aug. 2023]** Joined OSU, and am honored to work in OSU NLP Group.
